title: Demand Prediction Model Design
status: proposed
date: 2025-10-18
---

## Context and Problem Statement

MobilityCorp’s new platform must **predict vehicle demand across hubs and regions** to optimise:

- **Fleet distribution and rebalancing** (routing, ADR-005)  
- **Pricing and promotion strategies** (ADR-002)  
- **Field operations scheduling** (battery swaps, recovery tasks)  
- **User experience personalisation / concierge service**  

The system must provide:
- Accurate short-term forecasts (hourly to 72 hours)  
- Medium-term projections (weekly/monthly) for planning  
- Explanations for each forecasted pattern (compliance + business trust)  
- Cost transparency and graceful fallback when data or models are unavailable  

Given MobilityCorp’s historical dataset (years of telemetry, weather, events, and operational logs), the platform can support **multi-model AI forecasting** rather than simple heuristics.

---

## Questions

- Which forecasting approach best balances **accuracy, interpretability, and compute cost**?  
- How do we combine different model types for optimal performance?  
- How do we integrate forecasts with downstream services (Routing, Pricing, Concierge)?  
- How do we meet GDPR and EU AI Act explainability requirements?  
- How do we prevent model drift or bias across cities and regions?  

---

## Options

### Option A — Heuristic / Rules-Only Baseline
Use moving averages, seasonal multipliers, and fixed weather coefficients.

**Pros**
- Transparent, robust, and cheap.
- Useful fallback when data or model unavailable.

**Cons**
- Cannot adapt to sudden events or complex seasonality.
- Manual tuning required per region.

---

### Option B — Classical ML / Time-Series Models
Per-hub or pooled models (e.g., **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **Prophet**, **SARIMAX**) using engineered features: historical demand, weather, calendar, and event data.

**Pros**
- Good balance between accuracy, interpretability, and cost.  
- Explainable via feature importance and SHAP values.  
- Easy to deploy in CPU-only environments.

**Cons**
- Requires feature engineering and tuning.  
- Limited performance for long-term or cross-hub dependencies.

---

### Option C — Deep Learning Forecasting (TFT, LSTM, N-BEATS)
Train deep models for city-wide, multi-horizon forecasting using temporal, exogenous, and spatial correlations.

**Pros**
- Learns complex temporal and spatial relationships.  
- Handles non-linear interactions and irregular events.  

**Cons**
- Higher compute and maintenance cost.  
- Harder to explain and validate under AI governance.  
- Needs GPU/accelerator infrastructure.

---

### Option D — Composite Forecasting Platform (**Recommended**)
Adopt a **hybrid ensemble** combining classical and deep-learning models, wrapped in a standard **Forecasting Service** behind the **AI Interchange Layer (ADR-0016)**.

**Design characteristics:**
- Ensemble weighting by recent model accuracy per hub/region.  
- Predicts demand for each hub, hour, and vehicle type.  
- Includes contextual signals: weather, events, transit strikes, holidays.  
- Produces explainability metadata (feature importances + residuals).  
- Logs every forecast and version for audit and retraining.

**Pros**
- Leverages MobilityCorp’s historical data to reach high accuracy.  
- Combines interpretability and advanced pattern recognition.  
- Supports different horizons (operational vs strategic).  
- Enables downstream optimisation (routing, pricing).  

**Cons**
- Increased complexity in orchestration and governance.  
- Requires dedicated ML Ops pipeline and feature store.  
- Higher initial setup cost.

---

### Option E — Personalised Forecasts (Concierge Tier, Opt-In)
(Optional premium module)
Predicts individual user demand (e.g., “likely to rent a van on weekends”), used for personalised notifications or pre-positioning.

**Pros**
- Enhances user engagement and retention.  
- Can inform proactive fleet allocation near expected users.

**Cons**
- Must be **strictly opt-in** (GDPR).  
- Requires anonymised training and consent records.  

---

## Recommendation

Adopt **Option D: Composite Forecasting Platform** as the baseline service for MobilityCorp’s next-generation predictive infrastructure.

- Deploy a **Forecasting Service** that aggregates classical ML and deep-learning models into a composite prediction.  
- Integrate through the **AI Interchange Layer** to ensure consistent governance, cost tracking, and explainability.  
- Maintain **heuristics (Option A)** as deterministic fallback during outages or budget constraints.  
- Enable **Personalised Forecasting (Option E)** only in GDPR-compliant opt-in contexts.  
- All forecasts and explanations are stored in the **Data Platform (ADR-0007)** for retraining and audit.

---

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Uses existing historical data to deliver immediate ROI.  
- Provides explainable, multi-horizon forecasts supporting multiple business functions.  
- Creates a foundation for continuous learning and model governance.  
- Fully EU-hosted; no dependency on third-party SaaS.  

**Trade-offs**
- Higher implementation complexity (ensemble management, retraining cadence).  
- Requires strict cost and drift monitoring.  
- Needs coordination between Data, AI, and Ops teams.

### Alternatives Considered

* Single-model strategy — rejected; reduces flexibility and explainability.
* Third-party forecasting SaaS — rejected due to GDPR, lock-in, and cost.
* Deep-only approach — deferred; adds complexity without strong ROI.
