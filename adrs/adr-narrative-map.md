**How to read this map:**
- Each node is an ADR (001â€“008) with its title.
- Arrows indicate architectural dependency or narrative flow (e.g., "builds on", "depends on").
- The Data Platform (ADR-007) is central, supporting AI/ML, routing, alerting, and mobile sync.
- Reliability patterns (ADR-001) underpin all other ADRs.
- Mobile Offline Sync (ADR-008) and Alerts (ADR-006) both depend on the event-driven platform and reliability standards.
