title: AI Interchange Layer Architecture
status: proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

MobilityCorp’s AI platform must support multiple AI services (forecasting, routing, pricing, explainability, etc.) in a way that ensures:
- Consistent governance and compliance (GDPR, EU AI Act)
- Cost and usage tracking across all AI workloads
- Standardised APIs and integration patterns
- Centralised monitoring, logging, and auditability
- Flexibility to add, update, or replace AI models and services

A dedicated orchestration and governance layer is needed to mediate between AI services and consumers, enforce policies, and provide a unified interface.

---

## Decision

Adopt an **AI Interchange Layer** as a central component of the AI platform. The AI Interchange Layer will:
- Provide a standard API gateway for all AI services (e.g., /predict, /explain, /metrics)
- Enforce authentication, authorisation, and request validation
- Track and log all requests, responses, and model versions for audit
- Integrate with cost guardrails (ADR-018) and governance (ADR-017)
- Route requests to the appropriate AI service or model based on policy, cost, or performance
- Support versioning, A/B testing, and blue/green deployments of AI models
- Expose monitoring and metrics endpoints for operational visibility

---

## Rationale

- Centralises governance, security, and cost control for all AI services
- Simplifies integration for downstream consumers (apps, APIs, analytics)
- Enables rapid iteration and safe deployment of new models/services
- Supports compliance and audit requirements

## Implementation Details (High-level)

| Component         | Functionality                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| API Gateway      | Unified entry point for all AI service requests     |
| Auth Layer       | Authentication and authorisation enforcement        |
| Request Router   | Directs requests to correct model/service           |
| Policy Engine    | Applies cost, governance, and routing policies      |
| Audit Logger     | Logs all requests, responses, and model versions    |
| Metrics Exporter | Exposes usage, latency, and error metrics           |
| Version Manager  | Handles model versioning and deployment strategies  |

- Integrates with Feature Store (ADR-016), Data Platform (ADR-007), and all AI services
- All access and actions are logged for compliance
- Designed for extensibility as new AI services are added

---

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Improves security, compliance, and operational control
- Reduces integration effort for new AI services
- Enables cost and usage transparency

**Trade-offs**
- Adds a layer of operational complexity and potential latency
- Requires ongoing policy and version management
