title: AI Governance & Explainability
status: proposed
date: 2025-10-22
---

## Context and Problem Statement

MobilityCorp’s AI systems must comply with regulatory requirements (GDPR, EU AI Act) and internal standards for transparency, fairness, and accountability. This requires:
- Traceability of model decisions
- Explainability for business and regulatory stakeholders
- Monitoring for bias, drift, and performance
- Audit trails for all predictions and model changes

---

## Decision

Establish an AI Governance & Explainability framework that:
- Captures and stores model metadata, feature importances, and explanations for every prediction
- Provides dashboards and APIs for explainability (e.g., SHAP values, feature attributions)
- Monitors for bias, drift, and model performance over time
- Integrates with the Data Platform (ADR-007) and AI Interchange Layer
- Supports audit and compliance reporting

---

## Rationale

- Ensures compliance with external regulations and internal policies
- Builds business and user trust in AI-driven decisions
- Enables rapid detection and mitigation of bias or drift

## Implementation Details (High-level)

| Component         | Functionality                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Metadata Store    | Logs model versions, features, and explanations    |
| Explainability API| Provides access to feature importances, SHAP, etc. |
| Monitoring       | Tracks accuracy, bias, drift, and fairness metrics  |
| Audit Trail      | Records all predictions and model changes           |
| Dashboard        | Visualizes explainability and governance metrics    |

- All predictions and explanations are logged for audit
- Regular fairness and drift audits are scheduled
- Alerts are generated for significant bias or performance drops

---

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Improves compliance and transparency
- Reduces risk of regulatory penalties
- Increases stakeholder trust

**Trade-offs**
- Adds operational and reporting overhead
- Requires investment in monitoring and dashboarding tools
