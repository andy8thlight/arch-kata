## Context and Problem Statement

MobilityCorp’s AI and analytics platform requires a robust, scalable, and governed way to manage the input features used for model training and inference. Features are derived from diverse sources (telemetry, weather, events, operational data) and must be consistent, fresh, and versioned to support:

- Accurate and reproducible model training
- Real-time and batch inference
- Explainability and auditability (compliance)
- Cross-team collaboration and feature reuse

---

## Decision

Adopt a centralised Feature Store as a core component of the AI data platform. The Feature Store will:

- Ingest, transform, and store features from multiple data sources
- Provide APIs for feature retrieval (online for inference, offline for training)
- Support feature versioning, lineage, and freshness validation
- Integrate with the Data Platform (ADR-007) and Forecasting Service
- Enforce schema validation and access controls

---

## Rationale

- Ensures consistency between training and inference features
- Enables rapid experimentation and model retraining
- Supports compliance (GDPR, AI Act) via lineage and audit logs
- Reduces duplication and errors by enabling feature reuse

## Implementation Details (High-level)

| Component         | Functionality                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Feature Ingestion | ETL pipelines from telemetry, weather, events, ops |
| Feature Registry  | Catalog, version, and document features            |
| Online Store      | Low-latency feature serving for inference          |
| Offline Store     | Bulk feature access for model training             |
| Validation Layer  | Schema, freshness, and quality checks              |
| Access Control    | Permissions and audit logging                      |

- Features are refreshed hourly (or as needed) from source systems
- Feature freshness and schema are validated before use
- All feature access is logged for audit and compliance

---

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Improves model accuracy and reproducibility
- Simplifies governance and compliance
- Accelerates model development and deployment

**Trade-offs**
- Adds operational complexity and infrastructure cost
- Requires coordination between Data, AI, and Ops teams
