title: AI Cost & Budget Guardrails
status: proposed
date: 2025-10-22
---

## Context and Problem Statement

AI workloads (training, inference, data processing) can incur significant and unpredictable costs, especially as usage scales. MobilityCorp must ensure that AI operations remain within budget and that cost overruns are detected and managed proactively.

---

## Decision

Implement AI Cost & Budget Guardrails as part of the AI Interchange Layer and Data Platform. This includes:
- Real-time monitoring of AI resource usage and costs (compute, storage, API calls)
- Budget thresholds and automated alerts for overruns
- Cost attribution by service, model, and team
- Integration with Forecasting Service and Feature Store for cost-aware operations
- Automated fallback to lower-cost models or heuristics when limits are reached

---

## Rationale

- Prevents unexpected cost overruns and budget exhaustion
- Enables cost transparency and accountability
- Supports cost-aware model selection and fallback

---

## Implementation Details (High-level)

| Component         | Functionality                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Cost Monitor      | Tracks real-time usage and spend                   |
| Budget Manager    | Sets and enforces budget thresholds                |
| Alerting System   | Notifies teams of approaching/exceeded budgets     |
| Cost Attribution  | Breaks down costs by model, service, and team      |
| Fallback Handler  | Switches to cheaper models/heuristics as needed    |

- All cost data is logged and available for audit
- Cost guardrails are enforced at both training and inference stages
- Fallbacks are logged and reported for review

---

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Reduces risk of runaway costs
- Improves financial planning and accountability
- Enables cost-efficient AI operations

**Trade-offs**
- May require additional engineering and monitoring infrastructure
- Fallbacks may reduce prediction accuracy during budget constraints
